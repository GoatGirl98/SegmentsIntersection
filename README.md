SegmentsIntersection
====================

A sweep line algorithm for segments intersection, with OpenGL illustrating the result.

Compiled with Visual Studio 2010.
Need OpenGL environment.
Or you can cut out the gl* functions and use it as a pure C project.

Resize the window to get new segments set and result.
